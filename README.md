# BlackJack-Project

Created a BlackJack Project using Python.
Blackjack is a classic card game where players try to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. This Python project simulates a simple game of blackjack between a player and a dealer. The game uses a standard deck of cards, and players can hit or stand to improve their hand. The dealer follows a fixed strategy of hitting until reaching at least 17. The winner is determined based on hand values after both players finish their turns.
I've used Python to execute this project and determine the winner based on hand values after both players finish their turns.
Basic Functions and loops were used to execute this project.
